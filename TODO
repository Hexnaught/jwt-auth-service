        Is this needed? Are we going to have short/long live tokens
        We probably should

      Mongo? Postgres?
      Leaning towards mongo
  Mongo:
    ☐ Look at setting up mongo schema with constraints in `mongo-init.js`
      With docker-compose, we cant initialise the databases with indexes as the mongo container takes too long
      to spin up vs our app, so the database isn't reachable. We could set up polling or something but that
      feels like a shit solution.
      Lets just move all of the config and setup to the init file.
      !! This seems to have actually worked noww ith docker-compose?
