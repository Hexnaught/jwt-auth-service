Todo:
  ✔ Add AUTOTLS / Cert management within the service @done
    Might move this to IAC, look in to something like traefik, helm, build pipeline/auto deploys, etc.
  ✔ Create readme @done
    Need to add some initial details, running app, env vars, etc
  Endpoints:
    ✔ Login @done
    ✔ Logout @done
    ✔ Register @done
    JWT:
      ✔ Generate token functionality @done
      ✔ Validate token functionality @done
      ☐ Refresh token functionality
        Is this needed? Are we going to have short/long live tokens
        We probably should
  Infrastructure:
    Docker:
      ✔ Docker File @done
      ✔ Docker Compose File @done
    ✔ Database @done
      Mongo? Postgres?
      Leaning towards mongo
  Mongo:
    ✘ Look at setting up mongo schema with constraints in `mongo-init.js` @cancelled
      Not doing this for now...

Wider Architecture:
  ☐ Decide on whether I want to tightly couple this app with other planned infrastructure.
    Do I want to put external app specific logic, such as for payloads, in to this service. Or do I want to keep this
    service fairly generic and, for instance, pass through any request body data not within our 'user' definition
    in to the JWT, so other services can auth, passing extra data to embed in the JWT for them to send on to more services?
    Thoughts here, `App (Creds, Extra Data) -> Auth Service (JWT) -> App (JWT) -> [Server 1, Server 2, Server 3]`
    Another thing to keep in mind, we dont want to overload the JWT with information, only what other services need.
    UserID being the primary thing.
  ☐ Look in to using traefik
